"""
Data Processors Module

This module contains processors for transforming and analyzing NHL data.

Processors:
    - ZoneAnalyzer: Zone-based aggregation and analysis
    - SegmentProcessor: Game segment processing and analysis
    - HeatMapProcessor: Heat map generation and analysis
    - MatchupProcessor: Historical matchup tracking and analysis
    - ChemistryTracker: Synergy and line chemistry analysis
    - SeasonSegmentPipeline: Season phase × game phase aggregation
    - PlayerShotLocationPipeline: Player shot location profiles for simulation/heat maps
