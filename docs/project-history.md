# Project History (Condensed)

## Origins
The project began as a player-first analytics effort focused on zone-based performance and segment-aware trends, with the goal of feeding those insights into a predictive simulation engine.

## Milestones to Date
- **Data foundation**: Established the SQLite schema and collectors for players, game logs, and shot events.
- **Analytics layer**: Added zone aggregation, segment processing, and matchup tracking.
- **Synergy & context**: Implemented chemistry signals plus clutch and stamina indicators.
- **Simulation & workflow**: Delivered a Monte Carlo simulation engine and a local CLI workflow for running predictions end-to-end.

## Current Focus
- Build a backtesting and calibration harness for historical seasons.
- Expand multi-season data coverage to strengthen model confidence.
